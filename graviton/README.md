❌ Issue:
This C++ code processes an array of floats using scalar operations, making it slow on Arm CPUs that support NEON SIMD instructions.

❌ Why This is Inefficient on ARM
Loops through elements one by one → Cannot utilize NEON SIMD.
No compiler hints for vectorization → Compiler may not optimize.
Wastes CPU cycles → Each operation runs sequentially.

✅ Solution:
Uses ARM NEON intrinsics (vld1q_f32, vmulq_f32, vaddq_f32, vsin_f32).
Processes 4 floats at a time (instead of one by one).
Avoids scalar computations and leverages hardware acceleration.

✅ Why This is Optimized for ARM
Processes 4 elements at a time instead of looping through one-by-one.
Uses NEON SIMD intrinsics for parallel execution.
Handles leftover elements to maintain correctness.
Uses vld1q_f32, vmulq_f32, vaddq_f32, vsin_f32, and vst1q_f32 for efficient computations.

3️⃣ Compiler Optimizations for ARM
When compiling for ARM-based processors, use the following flags to enable vectorization and hardware-specific optimizations.

Compilation for ARM NEON

```
g++ -O3 -march=armv8-a+simd -ffast-math -fopenmp program.cpp -o program_arm
```

Explanation of Flags

```
Flag	                Purpose
-O3	                    Enables aggressive optimizations.
-march=armv8-a+simd	    Enables NEON SIMD instructions.
-ffast-math	            Allows faster floating-point optimizations.
-fopenmp	            Enables multi-threading for parallel execution.
